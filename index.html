        <h2>About Lizzy</h2>
            <p>I grew up as an only child <span class="error">in North China</span>. I am now a senior
                student majoring in Business Analytics and Finance at the University of Iowa, and 
                will graduate this December. I am passionate about using technical skills to solve
                business problems, such as using collected data to generate patterns and give solutions.
                
                I like to travel to different countries to absorb different cultures and enjoy local 
                food during my free time. I have traveled to Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, 
                Thailand,  and Australia. I also enjoy talking to people, learning different perspectives, 
                reading, hiking, and jogging when I am not busy studying.   </p>
